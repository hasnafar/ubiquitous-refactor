# ubiquitous-refactor

This challenge was about refactoring code. Refactoring code means restructing existing code without changing behavior. I cleaned up the code by organizing it and changing non-semantic elements to semantic ones. The code was updated to follow accessibility standards. For example, alternative attributes were added to images. I added comments before section for clarity. I added a descriptive title and made sure the links were functioning properly.
